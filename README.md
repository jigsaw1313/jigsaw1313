Hi , 
This is Mohammadreza . I was born in Tehran - Iran. 
When i was 19, i started to learn computer sceinces such as Network + , Microsoft Windows Server , Cisco CCNA and etc.\n
These corses were really intersting for me , as my current job is compelty different i didn't wroked in computer science field too much.\n
For now , i'm trying to learn Python Programming , is been about 5 or 6 months that i started to learn Programming.\n I'm really interested into AI and Data Science.\n
As a new learner i would like to share my codes with you here , i know they are really basic and easy but maybe they will be useful for someone.\n
i will be glad if you visit my codes and write your oponion and ideas as it will really help to improve myself.
