Passionate about technology and programming, I have a background in electronics and experience in IT management. I have studied a variety of Microsoft courses, including Installing and Configuring Windows Server, Administering Windows Server, Active Directory, and Network+. Additionally, I hold CCNA certification. With one year of experience as an IT manager at Ahvaz airport, I have developed strong skills in managing complex IT environments.

Currently, I am working as a sales agent at Turkish Airlines while pursuing my passion for programming. I am particularly interested in Python and AI, and I am constantly learning and improving my skills. In my free time, I enjoy playing football and taking new courses to expand my knowledge and expertise.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in the technology and programming fields. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities.
